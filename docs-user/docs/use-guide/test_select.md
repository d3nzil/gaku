# Learning, testing and practice
## Selecting what to learn, test or practice
To learn or to practice click the `Select Test` in the top menu.

There are multiple things that can show there.

1. Test status section - this will show you how many due cards and new cards are there. New cards are the ones you haven't learned yet in Gaku. Due cards are the ones scheduled to be tested again based on their test history. To decide when that happens Gaku uses spaced repetition (SRS) - a technique based on how human memory works to decide the best time to remind the cards.

2. Next to the test status section there is forecast of upcoming due cards. This is there so you know what to expect in coming days. Initially there will be only zeros, but once you start learning, it will fill up.

3. Not visible initially, but when you have started test and not finished it yet, below the Test section there will be small section showing current test status and a button to jump back to the session

4. New Test Settings - here you can customize what and how will you learn and practice.
    - Test type 
        - Standard test (default) - this mode will update the spaced repetition scheduling based on correct and incorrect answers. This mode is recommended in most cases.
        - Practice test (not marked) - this mode will not affect the card scheduling. It is best used for when you need to practice for class or test and don't want to mess up your schedule.
    - Number of cards to study - this one might sound self-explanatory, but you might be surprised to see higher number displayed next to question count in the test. This is because for e.g. vocabulary card, there is question about meaning and another about reading, resulting in 2 questions for the card.
    - Generate extra questions - checking this (default) will add extra questions to the test.
        - For vocabulary cards, there will be extra question about kanji the vocabulary contains.
        - For kanji cards there will be extra question about which radical is associated with it.
        - There are no extra questions for other types of cards.
    - Select source - by default, when learning new vocabulary, Gaku presents you the oldest vocabulary first, in order you originally imported it. If you want to study something specific (e.g for book you want to read), you can select source (or multiple sources) to study. When source or sources are selected, Gaku will present you the cards belonging to that source instead of the default order.
    - Select card types - this is mostly useful for practice mode and Multicards - here you can select one or more of types of card and then Gaku will present you with only questions for selected card types. By default, (empty selection), it will present you with all card types. The reason for suggesting practice mode is that new cards are learned in order and hiding some card types would make learning harder. For due card it is best to study them all regularly. But when you need e.g. to practice vocabulary for test, this is when this option comes handy. This also comes handy when you have Multicards with sets of Kanji (or words) that you mistake for each other and only want to practice these.

5. Next are buttons for starting practice and test:
    - Study Due Cards - this is for reminding learned cards, based on the SRS scheduling
    - Study New Cards - this is for learning new vocabulary and will present you questions in order. Specifically, it will first show you radical question (if not learned yet) for a kanji, then that kanji (again, if not learned yet) and then finally a new vocabulary consisting of the kanji.
    - Study Any State Cards - this will present you with all cards that match current test settings. So if you want to study cards (e.g. for test), when they are not yet due, use this.

6. Recent mistakes is the final section. It shows how many cards that had at least one of questions answered incorrectly in the last week. Note that only the most recent mistake is counted. Clicking the `[Number] day ago` text will set the time clicked in the right section. In the right section, if you want to practice the cards with mistakes, you can set how far in past to select cards with mistakes. Below that you will see how many cards will be practiced as the amount depends on the test settings. And finally there is button to practice the cards.

With that, the test selection is covered.
