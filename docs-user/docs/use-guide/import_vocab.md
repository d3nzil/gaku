# About importing
Importing is a way to get vocabulary and other learning data into Gaku, so they can be studied.

# Importing vocabulary
Before importing new vocabulary, it is best to have a Source created, as described above.

To import a wordlist, go to import section. In there you have two options - if you have a wordlist created as described in previous section, you can just load file using the browse button. After that the contents of the file should appear in the box below.

Alternatively you can copy the wordlist and paste it in the box below the browse button.

Once the list of words is there, click the `Generate imports` button. It might take a bit, but after a moment a list of generated cards should appear next to it in the `Generated imports` section. If there were any problems during the card generation, messages will appear below the Generate imports button.

Note: Card in Gaku are a piece of knowledge (vocabulary, kanji...) to study. At the moment these types of cards - radicals, kanji, vocabulary and multicards. (There are custom questions, but these are currently not ready for use.)

Check the generated cards - in Japanese the same kanji or kana can be used for multiple words, so sometimes there are multiple different cards. In case there is a card that is not relevant, you can remove it using the delete button on top of the card.

In addition to extra cards, the dictionary sometimes contains entries like `to be able to ..., can ...` as single entry, and it is not easy to handle special cases like this, so these need to be checked manually.

For vocabulary cards you can also disable testing of some meanings, as some words can have a lot of meanings and some of them might not be relevant.

There is also option mark some readings, writings, meanings as required. Required means that it will be required in test as answers. Not required means the answer is optional - not needed, but accepted.

Once you are happy with the list, select a source (or multiple if needed for some reason) and click the `Import cards` button on the left. After a moment, the carts will be imported and the Generated imports section will be cleared. Now the cards are ready to be studied.

Note that while I have some plans on how to avoid the need to check the cards, it will take some time to get it working.
