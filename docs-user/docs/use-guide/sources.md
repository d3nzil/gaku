# About sources
Source is used to tell where the word comes from - book, manga, textbook, etc. While not strictly needed, I do recommend using it, to keep things organized.

# Creating a source
To create a new source, go to the Sources section. In the `Add source` section there will be two text inputs - `Source Name` and `Source Section`. The name is intended for the name of the book or other source - e.g "Ranma 1/2", the section for specific book and chapter - e.g. "Book 1, Chapter 2". Only the name is required.

Once you fill in the fields, click the `Add Source` button and it should be added. If not, see the reporting problems section.

Admittedly, this organization is not ideal, but was good enough to get started. Hopefully when the more important parts will be finished, this will get improved too.
